"This city’s too bright.\
 Bright like people who forgot how to dream.\
 Every step feels like I’m walking on coins.\
 Each brick charges interest."
"They call it the free market.\
 I see nothing but anxiety… and schedules."
"We read philosophy booklets by the rice fields.\
 Didn’t know many words,\
 but we knew what 'the people' meant."
"You always took the neatest notes."
"Now? Maybe you’re up there.\
 Turning blank paper into numbers,\
 numbers into someone else's fate."
