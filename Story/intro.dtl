"My name is A-Mei. Seventy years old. Retired history teacher."
"Fifty years ago, she and I believed we could change the world. Her name was Lily."
"She crossed the ocean. Said she wanted to learn technology. Save the people."
"She never came back. I never heard from her again."
"Now I’m here. Not for answers. Just to see if she’s still here..."
"...or if she sank with the world she once tried to save."
